Consider a matrix $M$ constructed as the outer product of a column vector $v$: 

$$
\begin{equation}
v = [v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n]^T, \quad\quad M = v\, v^T.
\end{equation}
$$ 

The resulting matrix $M$ is a symmetric $n \times n$:  

$$
\begin{equation}\label{M}
    M = \begin{bmatrix} 
    v_{1}^2 & v_1 v_2 & \dots  & v_1 v_n \\
    v_2 v_1 & v_2^2 & \dots & v_2 v_n \\
    \vdots & & \ddots & \vdots\\
    v_n v_1 & \dots  & \dots & v_{n}^2 
    \end{bmatrix},
\end{equation} 
$$

Notice that the columns of $M$ can be written as 

$$
v_i \begin{bmatrix}v_1 \\  \vdots \\ v_n\end{bmatrix}
$$

where $v_i$ are the components of $v$ for $i = 1,\dots n$. This implies that, we can always scale a column by a factor of $v_j / v_i$ to obtain another. Therefore, all columns are linearly dependent and $M$ is a rank 1 matrix. On the other hand, since $M$ is symmetric $n\times n$, it is diagonalizable with all eigenvalues on the diagonal: 

$$
\begin{equation}
Q M Q^{T} = M_D = \begin{bmatrix} 
    \lambda_{1} & 0 &  \dots  & 0 \\
    0 & \lambda_2 & \dots & 0\\
    \vdots & & \ddots & \vdots\\
    0 & \dots  & \dots & \lambda_{n} 
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
$$

where $Q$ is the orthogonal matrix $Q^T = Q^{-1}$ whose columns are the corresponding eigenvectors of $M$ with unit norm. Using the properties of determinant and trace operation on this relation, we have

$$
\begin{equation}\label{det}
\textrm{det}(M_D) = \textrm{det}(M) = \prod_{i = 1}^n \lambda_i = 0 , \quad\quad \textrm{tr}(M) = \textrm{trace}(M_D) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \lambda_i  = v^T v = |v|^2
\end{equation}
$$

Since $M$ is rank 1, the only non-zero eigenvalue will be $\lambda = v^T v$, while the other $n-1$ eigenvalues will be zero consistent with \eqref{det}. Finally, notice that 

$$
\begin{equation}

M v = |v|^2 v

\end{equation}
$$

so that the vector $v$ itself is an eigenvector corresponding to $\lambda = v^T v$. On the other hand, for the zero eigenvalue (with multiplicity $n -1$) any vector $x$ that is orthogonal to $v$ is an eigenvector

$$
\begin{equation}

M x = v (v^T x) = 0 \longrightarrow v^T x = 0 \longrightarrow x \perp v

\end{equation}
$$ 

For a vector $v$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, there are $n-1$ such vectors. 

The properties we discussed for the special rank one matrix $M$ \eqref{M} we identified above can in fact be generalized to any rank-1 matrix. Similar to the special case we focused, any rank-1 matrix have columns that are scalar multiples of each other. A matrix with such a property can be generically described as an outer product of two non-zero column vectors $v, w \in \mathbb{R}^n$: 

$$
\begin{equation}\label{Mg}
    M = v \, w^T = \begin{bmatrix}v_1 \\  \vdots \\ v_n\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} w_1  \dots  w_n \end{bmatrix}  = \begin{bmatrix} 
    v_{1}\,w_1 & v_1 w_2 & \dots  & v_1 w_n \\
    v_2 w_1 & v_2 w_2 & \dots & v_2 w_n \\
    \vdots & & \ddots & \vdots\\
    v_n w_1 & \dots  & \dots & v_{n}\, w_n 
    \end{bmatrix}. 
\end{equation} 
$$

A rank-1 $n \times n$ matrix is singular $\delta M = 0$ and have $n-1$ linearly dependent columns and therefore has an eigenvalue $\lambda = 0$ with multiplicity $n-1$. The corresponding eigenvectors satisfy $M x = v (w^T x) = 0$ and therefore belong to the $n-1$ dimensional subspace orthogonal to $w \in \mathbb{R}^n$. For the remaining non-zero eigenvalue, we write $M x  = v (w^T x) = \lambda x $ which implies that $x$ is scalar multiple of $v$: 

$$
x = \frac{(w^T x)}{\lambda} v
$$

and therefore $v$ is an eigenvector itself: $M v = v (w^T v) = \lambda v$ with the corresponding eigenvalue $\lambda = w^T v$. This is a scalar quantity and in fact gives the trace of the matrix $M$ \eqref{Mg}: 

$$
\lambda = w^T v = \sum_{i = 1}^n v_i \, w_i  = \textrm{tr}(M)
$$

These facts let us conclude that a rank-1 $n \times n$ matrix $M$ has two eigenvalues $\lambda = 0$ (with multiplicity $n-1$) and $\lambda = \textrm{tr}(M)$.
