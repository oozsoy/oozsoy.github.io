In a series of earlier posts, I covered Black-Scholes option pricing theory. There, we saw that assuming *risk-neutrality* of investors lead to a unique *arbitrage-free* price for European type options. In fact, assuming log-normality of the underlying stock price, we were able to derive a simple analytic formula that describes this price in terms a few parameters that characterize the contract, as well as the state of the market. In all these derivations, several concepts such as hedging, risk-neutrality of the investors and replication trick appeared in a rather convoluted way. Therefore, I would like to start this post by an attempt to clarify the role played by these concepts for pricing options. To make the discussion intuitive, first I will focus on simple single (time) step binomial tree as shown in Figure 1.
