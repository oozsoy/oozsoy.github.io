description: I talk about a common malpractice of mixing the notion of returns with log returns in the finance literature.  
math: true
---

The notion of "return" is one of the most basic and equally fundamental concept in finance. There are two common definitions that is utilized in the literature:
simple returns and log-returns. Arguably, the most of the literature refer to the former when the word "return" is mentioned. 
Since stock returns are very small, the difference between these two definitions from a purely numerical point of view is small. 
However, when we consider statistical properties of these variables such as expected values, variances and covariances, significant deviations can arise. 
In this post, I would like to illustrate the consequences of the misuse of financial returns, in the context of suboptimal portfolio selection and the 
determination of beta in CAPM. 

### Return vs log-return 
------

We start with the definitions of both returns. Given the price of a security $P_t$ at time $t$, the simple return at time $t$ for an investment on asset $i$ 
at time $t-1$ (i.e. return for a single discrete time period) is given by 

$$
\begin{equation}\label{R}
R^{(i)}_t = \frac{P^{(i)}_t}{P^{(i)}_{t-1}} - 1. 
\end{equation}
$$

On the other hand, the log-return for the same time period can be defined as 

$$
\begin{equation}\label{r}
r^{(i)}_t = \ln (1 + R^{(i)}_t) = \ln\left(\frac{P^{(i)}_t}{P^{(i)}_{t-1}}\right). 
\end{equation}
$$

Due to appearance of logarithm, the log returns have the appealing property of additivity (along the time axis) for multiple period investments.
For example, for an investment between $t = 0$ and $t$, the compounded log-return read as  

$$
\begin{equation}
r^{(i)}_{0:t} = \ln \left(\frac{P^{(i)}_t}{P^{(i)}_0}\right) =
\ln \left(\frac{P^{(i)}_t}{P^{(i)}_{t-1}}\frac{P^{(i)}_{t-1}}{P^{(i)}_{t-2}}\dots \frac{P^{(i)}_1}{P^{(i)}_{0}}\right) = r_1 + r_2 + \dots + r_t.
\end{equation}
$$

When described in terms of the simple returns of assets, the portfolio return (composed of $n$ assets) at time $t$ has a similar (weighted) additivity property

$$
\begin{equation}\label{Rp}
R^{(p)}_t = \sum_{i = 1}^n w_i R^{(i)}_t, \quad\quad \sum_{i = 1}^n w_i = 1.
\end{equation}
$$

Recall that Markowitz's [modern portfolio theory]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2022-10-14-MPT %}) utilizes this linear structure in the quest to find 
efficient portfolios. On the other hand, 
we know from \eqref{R} and \eqref{r} that simple returns can be related to log-returns as $R = \mathrm{e}^r - 1$ using which with \eqref{Rp} imply the
following relationship of portfolio log-returns in terms of the individual asset log-returns:

$$
r^{(p)}_t = \ln\left(\sum_{i = 1}^n w_i\, \mathrm{e}^{r^{(i)}_t}\right).
$$

Due to non-linearity of this relationship, portfolio managers prefer to work with its linear counterpart \eqref{Rp} using simple
returns $R^{(i)}$.

From \eqref{r}, it is clear that the log-returns have support over the entire real line, $r_t \in \mathbb{R}$ while the simple returns
defined within an asymmetric range: 

$$
\begin{equation}\label{Rran}
-1 \leq R_t < \infty.
\end{equation}
$$

This asymmetry does already suggest why simple returns are not a good candidate to exhibit normal distribution as compared to log-returns, which is a
natural property of the latter under the [random walk]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2022-06-25-random_walk %}) hypothesis.
Furthermore, for simple returns around zero $R^{(i)}_t \sim 0$, Taylor expansion of eq. \eqref{r} tells us that log-returns can be approximately equivalent
to simple returns, $r_t = \ln(1+R_t) \approx R_t$. This approximation is the main source of confusion in many practical implementations involving 
financial returns.

_**Figure 1.**  Simple returns $R$ vs log returns $r = \ln(1+R)$._

Fig. 1 confirms validity of the $r_t = \ln(1+R_t) \approx R_t$ approximation for $R \sim 0$. On the other hand, for large (simple) returns
in absolute value, $|R|\sim \mathcal{O}(1)$, it is clear that the difference between these two notions of return becomes more apparent. It is indeed
a well known fact that stock return distributions have tails, exhibiting extreme values of $|R|$ within the range \eqref{Rran}. In this case, we can no
longer expect the moments of the simple returns and log-return distributions to match.  

As we mentioned earlier, the standard textbook approach of asset pricing models give rise to normally distributed log-returns. In this case, we can compute
the moments for the corresponding simple returns. For example, if we take the expected value and variance of log-returns as $\mu_i$ and $\sigma_i^2$ 
for asset $i$, we have 

$$
\begin{equation}\label{er}
\mu_R = \mathbb{E}[R_i] = \mathbb{E}[\mathrm{e}^{r_i} - 1] = \mathrm{e}^{\mu_i + \sigma_i^2/2} - 1,
\end{equation}
$$

where we utilized the properties of the moment generating function (MGF) of the normally distributed variable $r_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_i,\sigma_i^2)$
(see [Appendix A](#appendix-a)).
Covariance of simple returns of two assets can be also derived in terms of the moments of the log
return counterparts as 

$$
\begin{align}
\nonumber \textrm{Cov}(R_i,R_j) &= \mathbb{E}[R_i\, R_j] - \mathbb{E}[R_i]\mathbb{E}[R_j],\\
\nonumber &= \mathbb{E}[(\mathrm{e}^{r_i} - 1)(\mathrm{e}^{r_j} - 1)] - (\mathrm{e}^{\mu_i + \sigma_i^2/2} - 1)(\mathrm{e}^{\mu_j + \sigma_j^2/2} - 1),\\
\nonumber &= \mathbb{E}[\mathrm{e}^{r_i + r_j}] - \mathrm{e}^{\mu_i + \mu_j + (\sigma_i^2 + \sigma_j^2)/2},\\
\label{covsr}&=  \mathrm{e}^{\mu_i + \mu_j + (\sigma_i^2 + \sigma_j^2)/2} \left(\mathrm{e}^{\sigma_{ij}} - 1\right)
\end{align}
$$

following the discussion in the Appendix. Here $\sigma_{ij}$ is the covariance of log returns $\textrm{Cov}(r_i,r_j) =\sigma_{ij}$.
Using \eqref{covsr}, variance of individual simple stock returns is given by 

$$
\begin{equation}\label{varR}
\mathbb{V}[R_i] \equiv \textrm{Cov}(R_i,R_i) = \mathrm{e}^{2\mu_i + \sigma_i^2}\left(\mathrm{e}^{\sigma_i^2} - 1\right). 
\end{equation}
$$

The lines above clearly illustrate the potential deviation of different moments of simple returns with respect to log-returns. 

Another differentiating concept between two returns appears when annualization of expected returns and (co)-variances is performed. For log returns this is naturally accomplished
by following the footsteps of the square root of time rule which is a fundamental property of random walks. Therefore, annualization is most 
convenient when applied to the different moments of the log-return distribution. 

### Potential malpractices  
------

To illustrate negative consequences of confusing simple returns with log-returns, we will focus on a toy example, discussing in detail how the
aferomentioned confusion can affect the optimal portfolio selection within Markowitz's mean-variance analysis. 

**Portfolio blunder with log-returns**: 

Let's assume a fiducial portfolio composed of four risky assets which have (multivariate) normally distributed
log returns ${\bf r} = [r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4]^T$ with ${\bf r} \sim \mathcal{N}({\bf E}, {\bf V})$.
We assume the mean log returns and their covariance matrix is given by

$$
\begin{equation}
{\bf E} = [0.16, 0.14, 0.12, 0.08]^T, \quad\quad
{\bf V} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0.20 & -0.05 & 0.00 & 0.00 \\
-0.05 & 0.15 & 0.01 & 0.02 \\
0.00 & 0.01 & 0.10 & 0.00 \\
0.00 & 0.02 & 0.00 & 0.04
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}
$$

Adopting the total budget constraint

$$
\begin{equation}\label{pc}
\sum_{i = 1}^4 w_i = 1,
\end{equation}
$$

one may tempt to think we have all we need to compute the optimal portfolio allocations based on
[MPT]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2022-10-14-MPT %}). However, recall that the inputs for MPT are
mean returns and covariances based on simple returns $R$. Utilizing \eqref{er}-\eqref{varR}
they are given by

$$
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\mu} = [0.2969, 0.2399, 0.1853, 0.1052]^T, \quad\quad
{\bf \Sigma} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0.3724 & -0.0784 & 0.0000 & 0.0000 \\
-0.0784 & 0.2488 & 0.0148 & 0.0277 \\
0.00 & 0.0148 & 0.1478 & 0.0000 \\
0.00 & 0.0277 & 0.0000 & 0.0498
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}
$$

Now the standard constrained \eqref{pc} optimization problem can be solved to obtain the efficient
portfolios that exbihit the least risk $\sigma_p$ for a given expected return $\mu_p$ within 
the entire risk-reward spectrum. We perform these calculations in [Appendix B](#appendix-b).
The resulting set of pairs $(\sigma_p, \mu_p)$ that are on the efficient frontier satisfy

$$
\begin{equation}\label{eff}
\sigma_p(\mu_p) = \sqrt{\frac{A \mu_p^2 - 2 B \mu_p + C}{AC - B^2}}, \quad\quad\quad \textrm{for} \quad \mu_p > B/A,
\end{equation}
$$

where we defined the following scalar variables in terms of the inverse of the covariance matrix, identity and mean return $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ vector as

$$
\begin{equation}\label{svs}
\boldsymbol{1}^T {\bf \Sigma}^{-1} \boldsymbol{\mu} = B, \quad \boldsymbol{1}^T {\bf \Sigma}^{-1} \boldsymbol{1} = A, \quad \boldsymbol{\mu}^T {\bf \Sigma}^{-1} \boldsymbol{\mu} = C.
\end{equation}
$$

The condition on the right in eq. \eqref{eff} stems from the fact that $\mu_{p} = B / A$ corresponds to return of the [global minimum variance portfolio]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2022-12-07-hedging %}) with the corresponding variance $\sigma_{p}^2(\mu_{p}^{*}) = A^{-1}$. Therefore, $\mu_{p} > B/A$ branch in the risk reward ($\sigma_p - \mu_{p}$) spectrum corresponds to the efficient frontier.

![svsmu](/assets/2023-08-02/svsmu.png){: w="900" h="400" }
_**Fig. 2**. Correct and False efficient frontier via eq. (13)._

In Figure 2, we compare the true efficient frontier \eqref{eff} with the one obtained through log returns by replacing $\boldsymbol{\Sigma} \to {\bf V}$, $\boldsymbol{\mu} \to {\bf E}$ in eqs. \eqref{eff} and \eqref{svs}. We observe that a confusion of the expected values and (co)variances of simple returns with those of the log returns can lead to non-negligibly suboptimal portfolio selection.

#### Appendix A: Moment generating function of random normal variables {#appendix-a}
-----

Let $X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2)$ be a random normal variable and consider its moment generating function 

$$
\begin{equation}\label{mgf}
M_X (t) = \mathbb{E}[\mathrm{e}^{t X}] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \mathrm{e}^{t x} f_X(x)\, \mathrm{d}x
\end{equation}
$$

where $f_X$ is the pdf of normal distribution. The expression above is a moment generating function in the sense that we can obtain the expectation values
for powers of $X$ by taking derivatives of \eqref{mgf} with respect to $t$ and then by sending $t \to 0$. For example, it is easy to see that
$\mathbb{E}[X] = M_X'(0)$. Taking higher derivatives of $M_X$ similar expressions for higher moments can be derived.  

Now notice by definition we can write the normal variable as $X = \mu + \sigma Z$ where $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$. We can then write the expectation value
in \eqref{mgf} as 

$$
\begin{align}
\nonumber \mathbb{E}[\mathrm{e}^{tX}] &= \mathrm{e}^{t \mu}  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\mathrm{e}^{(2 t \sigma z - z^2)/2}}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \, \mathrm{dz},\\
\nonumber &= \mathrm{e}^{t\mu + t^2 \sigma^2/ 2} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{e^{-y^2/2}}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \mathrm{d}y, \\
\label{mgfr}&= \mathrm{e}^{t\mu + t^2 \sigma^2/ 2}
\end{align}
$$

where we have completed the exponent inside the integral to a square in the second line defining a new variable of integration via $y = z - t\sigma$. 
The expression \eqref{mgfr} therefore gives us the expectation of the exponential of a random Gaussian variable as:  

$$
\begin{equation}\label{mx1}
M_X(1) = \mathbb{E}[\mathrm{e}^X] = \mathrm{e}^{\mu + \sigma^2/ 2}.
\end{equation}
$$

Now consider the sum of two gaussian random variables $r_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_i,\sigma_i^2)$ and $r_j \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_j,\sigma_j^2)$ that are
correlated as in the case of returns of two stocks. First, the random vector ${\bf r} = (r_i, r_j)^T$ ($i\neq j$) is multivariate normal, 
$r \sim \mathcal{N}({\bf \mu}, {\bf \Sigma})$ with ${\bf \mu} = (\mu_i,\mu_j)^T$. Then by definition of multivariate distribution, any linear combination 
of ${\bf r}$ will also be normally distributed. Therefore, consider the special linear combination $r_i + r_j = {\bf a}^T{\bf r}$ for ${\bf a} = (1,1)^T$
and $(r_i + r_j) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbb{E}[r_i + r_j], \mathbb{V}[r_i + r_j])$: 

$$
\begin{align}
\nonumber \mathbb{E}[r_i + r_j] &= \mu_i + \mu_j,\\
\mathbb{V}[r_i + r_j] &= \mathbb{V}[r_i] + \mathbb{V}[r_j] + 2\textrm{Cov}(r_i,r_j).
\end{align}
$$

On the other hand, since $r_i + r_j$ is normally distributed, it satisfies \eqref{mx1} in an analogous way:

$$
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}[\mathrm{e}^{r_i + r_j}] = \mathrm{e}^{\mathbb{E}[r_i + r_j] + \mathbb{V}[r_i + r_j]/ 2} = \mathrm{e}^{\mu_i + \mu_j + (\sigma_i^2 +\sigma_j^2)/2 + \sigma_{ij}}
\end{equation}
$$

where we defined the covariance $\textrm{Cov}(r_i,r_j) = \sigma_{ij}$.

#### Appendix B: Portfolio optimization and the efficient frontier {#appendix-b}
-----

First we focus on the constrained optimization problem of finding portfolio weights ${\bf w}$, which can be 
formulated as

$$
\begin{align}
\nonumber \mathop{\textrm{min}}_{\bf w}\,\,\sigma_p^2 &= {\bf w}^T\, {\bf \Sigma}\, {\bf w},\\
\textrm{s.t}\,\, {\bf w}^T {\boldsymbol{\mu}} &= \mu_p\,\, \textrm{and} \,\, {\bf w}^T {\bf 1} = 1. 
\end{align}
$$

We can solve the constrained system using the standard Lagrange multiplier method using the
following Lagrange function 

$$
L\left({\bf w}, \lambda_1, \lambda_2\right)=\mathbf{w}^{T}\, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}\, \mathbf{w}
+\lambda_1\left(\mathbf{w}^{T} \boldsymbol{\mu}-\mu_{p}\right)
+\lambda_2\left(\mathbf{w}^{T} \mathbf{1}-1\right).
$$

Varying the Lagrangian with respect to weight vector gives 

$$
\begin{equation}\label{solw}
{\bf w} = \frac{\lambda_1}{2} \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1} \boldsymbol{\mu} + 
\frac{\lambda_2}{2} \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1} \boldsymbol{1},
\end{equation}
$$

whereas the variation with respect to Lagrange multipliers $(\lambda_1,\lambda_2)$ give the original constraints trivially. Using these constraints with \eqref{solw}, we can determine $(\lambda_1,\lambda_2)$ solving the following set of equations: 

$$
\begin{align}
\nonumber \mathbf{w}^{T} \mathbf{1} &= 1 \quad \Rightarrow \,\,\,\,\quad \lambda_1 B + \lambda_2 A = 2,\\
\label{lamb}\mathbf{w}^{T} \boldsymbol{\mu} = \boldsymbol{\mu}^T \mathbf{w} &= \mu_p \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda_1 C + \lambda_2 B = 2\mu_p
\end{align}
$$

where we defined the following constants in terms of the inverse of the covariance matrix ${\bf \Sigma}^{-1} = ({\bf \Sigma}^T)^{-1} = ({\bf \Sigma}^{-1})^{T}$, mean return $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ and the identity vector $\boldsymbol{1}$: 

$$
\boldsymbol{1}^T {\bf \Sigma}^{-1} \boldsymbol{\mu} = B, \quad \boldsymbol{1}^T {\bf \Sigma}^{-1} \boldsymbol{1} = A, \quad \boldsymbol{\mu}^T {\bf \Sigma}^{-1} \boldsymbol{\mu} = C.
$$

In terms of these variables the system of equations \eqref{lamb} can be solved to obtain 

$$
\begin{equation}
\lambda_1 = \frac{2(A\mu_p - B)}{AC-B^2},\quad\quad \lambda_2 = \frac{2(C - B\mu_p)}{AC-B^2}.
\end{equation}
$$

Therefore, the optimal weights \eqref{solw} can be found as 

$$
\begin{equation}
{\bf w}^{*} = \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1} \left(\frac{(C - B\mu_p)}{AC-B^2} \boldsymbol{1} + \frac{(A\mu_p - B)}{AC-B^2} \boldsymbol{\mu} \right).
\end{equation}
$$

On the other hand, from \eqref{solw} and \eqref{lamb}, the variance of the portfolio returns can be obtained as 

$$
\begin{align}
\nonumber \sigma_p^2 &= {\bf w}^T\, {\bf \Sigma}\, {\bf w}\\
\nonumber &= \frac{1}{4} \left(C \lambda_1^2 + 2B\lambda_1\lambda_2 + A \lambda_2^2 \right)\\
\nonumber&= \frac{1}{4} \left(\lambda_1 (\lambda_1 C + \lambda_2 B) + \lambda_2 (\lambda_1 B + \lambda_2 A)\right)\\
\label{ef}&= \frac{1}{AC-B^2} \left(A \mu_p^2 - 2B \mu_p + C\right). 
\end{align}
$$

The relation \eqref{ef} gives the efficient portfolios (frontier) in the $\sigma_p$ and $\mu_p$ plane that have the minimum risk at a desired reward $\mu_p$.
