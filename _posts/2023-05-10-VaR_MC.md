In a series of earlier posts, I have introduced the concept of [Value at Risk]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2023-02-10-VaR_CVaR %}) and it's
[computation]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2023-03-20-VaR_SRF %}) for a portfolio consist of a number of shares of a single asset assuming the latter follows a [geometric brownian motion]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2022-07-22-GBM %}). This lead us to analytical formulate VaR of an investment in terms of the quantile of the log-return distribution of the asset, along with its drift and volatility. Focusing on real world stocks, I have then put these analytical formulas into a test for short term investments by comparing them with the historical method of VaR computation which does not rely on any assumption about asset's (log) return distribution. I would like to start this post by mentioning the other practical methods of Value at Risk computation focusing on the Monte Carlo simulation method. 

We start by reviewing the main idea behind each method assuming that each method is applied to portfolio consist of some number of assets. In general there are three main methods for VaR calculation for this purpose

1. Delta-Normal (or Variance-covariance) method
2. Historical method
3. Monte Carlo method

**Delta-Normal method**: As its name may suggest, this method relies on some technical assumptions on the dependence on portfolio's value with respect to the underlying assets in it. We will not get into the details here about the meaning of Delta in this context, but normal approximation should be intuitively clear. In this method, the main assumption is the normality of assets returns which implies that the portfolio returns (that is linear weighted combination of asset returns) are also normally distributed. Under this assumption, VaR (and CVAR) can be simply computed from the forecasts of portfolio returns and covariance matrix of returns. This method is sometimes also referred as variance-covariance method and also parametric method due its assumption on the distribution of portfolio returns. As this point, we note that one can also implement it using a more realistic distribution such as a t-distribution to take into account the observed fat tails of the asset/portfolio returns.

**Historical method**: This method applies current/desired positions to the past time-series data of assets in order to reconstruct the history of a hypothetical portfolio. Using the performence of this hypothetical portfolio, then the VaR and CVaR is obtained. In this sense, this method assumes the past portfolio performence will be indicative for the future. It has a powerful feature as compared to the parametric method, as no assumption is made about the distribution of portfolio returns. For a simple implementation of this method see my previous [post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2023-03-20-VaR_SRF %}). 

**Monte Carlo method**: In the Monte Carlo method, one first decide on the stocastic process and its parameters that will be used to simulate the portfolio performance over a specified time horizon. At this step, the parameters (such as volatility, correlation and mean returns of assets) and their distributions can be derived from the historical data. Given the positions of each asset in the portfolio, we can then simulate many fictitious paths for the portfolio value to determine the VaR (and CVaR) at the boundary of the time horizon of interest. One may argue that Monte Carlo approach has the advantage of potentially capturing possible future movements in the portfolio value which could in principle work for any distribution that does not simply rely on normality assumption. The method, unfortunately, can be computationally heavy depending on the asset universe and the time horizon under consideration. This approach will be the focus for the rest of this post. 

### Monte Carlo Method for VaR and CVaR 
-------

To illustrate the Monte Carlo method at work for VaR and CVaR estimates, I will focus on a portfolio composed of three assets `BP`, `NVDA` and `SBUX`.
In particular, I will focus on past two trading years of data between `2021-02-09` and `2023-02-09` to construct a maximum sharpe ratio portfolio within
the Markowitz's [portfolio theory]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2022-10-14-MPT %}) framework. For this purpose, I will utilize publicly available
`PyPortfolioOpt` library within the `asset` class (see [Appendix A](#appendix-a)) that I started developing in an earlier post. `PyPortfolioOpt` has many useful built-in methods that allows for portfolio optimization based on a variety of risk preferrences, for more details see the [documentation](https://pyportfolioopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The following code snippet gives the returns and log-returns for the time frame we are interested in and the corresponding max sharpe ratio portfolio obtained via mean-variance analysis: 

```python
# we sort tickers in alphabetic order
# because the downloaded data will appear in that order
# this is important when we interpret weight allocations
tickers = sorted(['NVDA', 'SBUX', 'BP']) # stocks
end_date = pd.to_datetime('2023-02-10') # start and end date
start_date = end_date - dt.timedelta(days = 732)

# initialize the class and download price data
price_data = asset(tickers, start_date, end_date)
price_data.download()

# returns and log-returns
return_df, log_return_df = price_data.to_returns()

# get allocation weights for max sharpe ratio portfolio
weights = price_data.get_allocations()

for idx, ticker in enumerate(tickers):
    
    print(f"Allocation for {ticker}: w = {weights[idx]}")
```
**Output:**

{% highlight text %}
[*********************100%%**********************]  3 of 3 completed
Price data downloaded for ['BP', 'NVDA', 'SBUX'] from 2021-02-08 00:00:00 to 2023-02-10 00:00:00
Allocation for BP: w = 0.5
Allocation for NVDA: w = 0.4333
Allocation for SBUX: w = 0.0667
{% endhighlight %}

The allocation weights obtained tells us that looking at the last two years of data, we should invest half of our money to `BP` and roughly $43 \%$ to `NVDA` 
and $7 \%$ to `SBUX` if we want to maximize sharpe ratio based on this historical data. Having obtained portfolio weights, 
we can keep track of the time evolution of the portfolio value for an initial investment of 1000 dollars (e.g 500 USD for BP, 430 USD for NVDA and 70 USD for SBUX) 
over a specified time horizon using Monte Carlo Simulation techniques. For this purpose, I have implemented a `mc_sim()` method that takes in the number 
of desired simulaton paths `mc_sims`, current portfolio value `current_pval` (e.g 1000 USD) to return portfolio value at the terminal time for all the paths. 
The method has an optional `plot` argument that is set to `True` by default to plot the resulting portfolio value paths. It relies heavily on the 
[Cholesky decomposition/factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesky_decomposition) of the historical covariance matrix. 
In simple terms, Cholesky decomposition allow us to determine the "square root" of the covariance matrix of asset returns which we can utilize to
generate correlated asset returns from independent ones sampled say from the Gaussian distribution. The resulting asset returns then can be weighted 
by the allocations we derived and aggregated appropriately to determine the portfolio value over the time horizon of interest. 
This is the essential utility of `mc_sim()` under the hood:

```python
port_val_sims = price_data.mc_sim(1000, current_pval=1000, plot = True)
```

![mc_sim](/assets/2023-05-10/mc_sim.png){: w="700" h="500" }
_**Figure 4.**  Monte Carlo simulations of max sharpe ratio (long-only) portfolio containing `'BP', 'NVDA', 'SBUX'` over 100 days. 
We constrained the weights on $w_i \in [0.01,0.5]$ for diversification. For this plot we ran 1000 simulations._

The different paths the portfolio value can take over a 100 day time horizon is shown in Fig 4. Once we have the distribution of the final portfolio values 
in the last time step corresponding to the right-most hand side of this plot. In particular, we can compute $1-c$ quantile $Q_{1-c}$ of this end point distribution which will
inform us about a potential bad scenario at this confidence level (e.g $100 c\, \% = 95\, \% $) where our portfolio value declines. Then the value at risk 
can be determined by substracting this value from the initial investment (or portfolio value) which we assumed to be 1000 USD. On the other hand, expected shortfall of the
portfolio value can be obtained by averaging over portfolio values that satisfy $PV < Q_{1-c}$. To implement the VaR and CVaR estimates within this Monte Carlo
framework, I have extended and updated the `risk` class I introduced in a former [post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2023-03-20-VaR_SRF %}) which can be 
found in [Appendix B](#appendix-b). VaR and CVaR estimates obtained in this way are shown in the code snipped below: 

```python
in_pval = 1000 # initial investment
dt = 100 # time horizon, actually necessary for historical method
fin_pvals = port_val_sims # portfolio values at last time slice
port_ret = price_data.get_portfolio_returns() # portfolio returns using get_portfolio_returns() method of `asset` class
risk_mc = risk(np.log(1+port_ret), dt, in_pval, fin_pvals)

print(f"Max sharpe ratio portfolio {tickers}, VaR = {risk_mc.mc_var():.3f} and CVaR = {risk_mc.mc_cvar():3f}")
```
**Output:**

{% highlight text %}
Max sharpe ratio portfolio ['BP', 'NVDA', 'SBUX'], VaR = 175.344 and CVaR = 243.869
{% endhighlight %}

These results tell us that with $95 \%$ confidence, our portfolio won't lose more than 175 USD in value on a 1000 initial capital over 100 days. If
it loses its value, the worst case scenario corresponds to a loss of 244 US in value within the same time horizon.
