Welcome!

I am a physicist with a strong passion in understanding how things work at a deeper level. I see the path for improvement in this context as a bit like the first post in this blog: a random walk where you can explore different angles at each step in order to have a broader view of your surroundings.

So, in an attempt to revise and further my knowledge, I decided to take a step in the directions that I find interesting and began writing about various topics related to Statistics, Finance and Machine Learning. As a researcher who learns the most effectively by explaining things to others with an optimal dosage of mathematics, numerical analysis and intuition, I always find this approach quite useful for progress and self development. 

The content I share in this blog are based on the some r√üesearch and reading I have done in the last two years. I will try to upload more as a find time to clear up my notes and prepare them in a presentable manner.  

Feel free to contact me via e-mail for questions and comments.
